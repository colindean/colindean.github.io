        <h1>Recruit me</h1>
        <div id="description" class="widget">
          <p class="blurb">
            I'm a software engineer and community builder with a penchant for journalism.
            I'm an aspiring polymath: My thirst for knowledge knows few topical boundaries.
            I once upon a time aspired to teach high school computer science.
            I've been involved in non-profits since 2000 and have been running events yearly for 20+ years.

            I would eventually like to find myself self-employed or working for
            someone with similar goals and talents, doing whatever I love and
            loving whatever I am doing.
            Some goals may include
            to become a CTO or Distinguished Engineer of a company that I did not start,
            to be a primary contributor from inception to a product that pays salaries for hundreds of people,
            never to compromise my integrity and ethics to ship a product or service knowingly,
            to create a team so cohesive and talented that anyone could leave at any time, but no one wants to,
            to create a world in which money is not an obstacle to learning.

                Please note that I am <strong>not actively pursuing opportunities</strong>
                for full-time employment, but I view <em>every</em> opportunity that
                makes its way into my inbox. Please don't be offended if I don't
                respond.

              <li>
                I would really only consider an opportunity that is in the

                >greater Pittsburgh area</a> or <strong>allows remote work</strong>.
                I live east of the city, so offices west of the confluence might as well be
                hours away for the purposes of commuting!
                I can work any U.S. time zone, having generally worked Pacific time daylight hours
                for most of my career.

              <li>
                Please do not bother to contact me with employment offers
                that <em>require</em> relocation, unless you absolutely must
                have me, and
                only I am suitable for the position you wish to fill, and
                compensation is <em

                If you're a recruiter, you must include the name of your client in your message.
                I have worked with recruiters previously and will not intentionally cause
                you to lose your commission should your attempts be successful.
                This revelation <em>in your initial outreach</em> is a non-negotiable expectation.
              </li>

              <li>
                If you can find it, under no circumstances should you
                email my work addresses with anything unrelated to work.
                Thanks for respecting my inbox and workflow!
                I might make fun of you on social media if you break this rule more than once.

          <h2>On Interviewing Colin</h2>
          <p class="blurb">
            If steps in your interview process not involving human interaction, please find alternatives.
            For example, if a code test takes more than two hours, please devise an abbreviated test before contacting me.
            Then, use that test on me and everyone else you interview after me
            because no code test should ever take more than two non-contiguous hours.
          </p>
          <p class="blurb">
            If contrived evaluations like whiteboarding, digital or in-person,
            would be a part of the interview,
            please skip these parts of the interview for me.
            These evaluations do not accurately reflect the skills of the candidates
            whom I have evaluated over the years.
            Even I, a confident public speaker and teacher, can choke in
            that exercise.
            I have long since eliminated whiteboarding from my interview processes
            because of its ineffectiveness and would not wish that method
            upon anyone, interviewee or interviewer.
          </p>
          <p class="blurb">
            Because of my involvements and obligations
            in community leadership activities, businesses, and family,
            I don't have the bandwidth to study for a technical examination
            even if such is directly related to the role for which you are pursuing me.
            I am happy to interview in a process
            that is well-defined but more accommodating of
            the life of an engaged professional with obligations outside
            of the workplace, such as children, a time-consuming hobby, or long-term volunteering.
